> Automated Reddit sentiment analysis for penny stock discovery

ThreadRadar scrapes penny stock subreddits, extracts ticker mentions, and runs financial sentiment analysis using FinBERT — turning hours of manual Reddit browsing into a ranked daily dashboard.

---

## The Problem

Finding promising penny stocks on Reddit means manually reading through hundreds of posts and comments across multiple subreddits like r/pennystocks, r/Pennystock, and r/smallstreetbets. A single post can have 200+ comments, many of which contain counter-arguments, DD (due diligence), or warnings that completely change the picture. Doing this manually takes hours.

ThreadRadar automates the entire pipeline and surfaces the top picks in seconds.

---

## How It Works

```
Reddit JSON API
      ↓
  scraper.py          → Fetches posts + all nested comments (hot & new)
      ↓
  extractor.py        → Extracts ticker symbols using regex + blacklist filtering
      ↓
  sentiment.py        → Scores each mention using FinBERT (financial BERT model)
      ↓
  main.py             → Aggregates scores, weights by upvotes, ranks tickers
      ↓
  output.json         → Consumed by React frontend dashboard
```

The sentiment score reflects the **full conversation** — not just the original post. A bullish post with bearish comments will score lower than a bullish post with supporting comments. This is the key insight: Reddit counters matter. We take the aggregate sentiment of the reddit comment tree to get the full score for a stock pick.

**Why FinBERT over VADER?**
General sentiment models don't understand financial language. VADER scores "this stock is going to the moon" as neutral. FinBERT was trained on financial news and analyst reports — it correctly understands terms like "bullish", "FDA approval", "short squeeze", and "dilution".

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- ~500MB disk space for FinBERT model (downloaded automatically on first run)

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/threadradar.git
cd threadradar/backend

# Install dependencies
pip install requests transformers torch yfinance

# Run the analysis pipeline
python main.py
```

The first run will download the FinBERT model (~500MB). Subsequent runs use the cached model and take 15–30 minutes depending on Reddit rate limits.

Output is written to `output.json` and `output.txt`.

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd threadradar/frontend

npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Running on a Schedule

**Linux/Mac (cron):**

```bash
# Run every day at 6 AM
0 6 * * * cd /path/to/threadradar/backend && python main.py
```

**Windows (Task Scheduler):**
Create a basic task that runs `python main.py` from the backend directory daily.

## Subreddits Monitored

| Subreddit              | Focus                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| r/pennystocks          | Primary — most active penny stock community |
| r/Pennystock           | Secondary — additional coverage             |
| r/smallstreetbets      | Tertiary — broader retail sentiment         |
| r/RobinHoodPennyStocks | Less traffic subreddit will add in future   |

---

## Scoring Algorithm

Each ticker's final score is calculated as:

```
final_score = avg_sentiment × (1 + mentions × 0.1) × (1 + avg_post_score × 0.01) | This formula is development in progress |
```

Where:

- `avg_sentiment` — weighted average FinBERT score across all mentions (-1 to +1)
- `mentions` — total number of times the ticker appeared across posts and comments
- `avg_post_score` — average Reddit upvote score of posts containing the ticker

Tickers with fewer than 2 mentions are filtered out to reduce noise.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Pump-and-dump risk** — Reddit penny stock communities are susceptible to coordinated pumping. High sentiment scores do not guarantee legitimate picks. Always do your own research.
- **OTC stock data gaps** — Some penny stocks trade OTC and may not have full price data available via Yahoo Finance.
- **Rate limiting** — Reddit's unauthenticated API limits requests. The pipeline includes automatic retry logic but the `top` category is sometimes unavailable.
- **FinBERT and Reddit slang** — FinBERT was trained on formal financial text. Reddit slang like "to the moon 🚀" scores as neutral rather than positive. This is intentional conservatism — we prefer false negatives over false positives.

## Roadmap

### V1 (Current)

- [x] Reddit scraper with recursive comment fetching
- [x] Ticker extraction with blacklist filtering
- [x] FinBERT sentiment analysis
- [x] Ranked output (JSON + TXT)
- [ ] React dashboard UI
- [ ] Yahoo Finance price integration

### V2 (Planned)

- [ ] Historical data storage (PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Search functionality for past picks
- [ ] Performance tracking — did the picks actually move?
- [ ] Subreddit weighting (r/pennystocks > r/smallstreetbets)
- [ ] Pump-and-dump detection (sudden mention spikes)
- [ ] Reddit OAuth for higher rate limits
- [ ] Stock specific subreddit to be analyzed for more data
